        <h3>WEB</h3>
        <p>The web is a hypermedia-based structure which provides a source of browsing information over the internet in a non-sequential format by the use of hyperlinks which redirects users to more resources and information. The World Wide Web abbreviated as WWW, supply a simple 'point and click' means of exploring and viewing and also storing a large volume of pages of information that are residing on the Internet.</p>
    
        <h3>WWW</h3>

        <h3>BROWSER</h3>
        <p>A software application used to access information on the World Wide Web is called a Web Browser. When a user requests some information, the web browser fetches the data from a web server and then displays the webpage on the user’s screen</p>
    
        <h3>ADDRESSBAR</h3>
        <p>The address bar also location bar or URL bar is the element that shows the current URL in a web browser. It is the familiar text field at the top of a web browser’s graphical user interface (GUI) that displays the name or the URL (uniform resource locator) of the current web page. Users request websites and pages by typing either the name or the URL into the address bar</p>
    
        <h3>TITLEBAR</h3>
        <p>the title bar is a horizontal bar located at the top of a window in a GUI. It displays the title of the software, name of the current document or file, or other text identifying the contents of that window</p>
    
        <h3>URL/URI</h3>
        <p>URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is often defined as a string of characters that is directed to an address. URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) is also a string of characters that identifies a resource on the web either by using location, name or both. It allows uniform identification of the resources.</p>
    
        <h3>HTTP/HTTPS</h3>
        <p>HTTP is abbreviated as Hypertext Transfer Protocol, an application layer protocol used primarily with the WWW (World Wide Web) in the client-server model where a web browser is a client communicating with the webserver which is hosting the website. HTTPS is a Hypertext transfer protocol secure is the secure version of HTTP, which is the primary protocol used to send data between a web browser and a website. HTTPS is encrypted in order to increase security data transfer. This is particularly important when users transmit sensitive data, such as by logging into a bank account, email service, or health insurance provider</p>
    
    
        <h3>EXTENSION</h3>
        <p>extension is the act of getting more time, space, or length, like an extension of a deadline that gives you one more day to turn in a paper, or extensions that make your hair look longer    </p>

        <h3>NETWORK</h3>
        <p>A network is a collection of computers, servers, mainframes, network devices, peripherals, or other devices connected to allow data sharing. An example of a network is the Internet, which connects millions of people all over the world. To the right is an example image of a home network with multiple computers and other network devices all connected    </p>
    
        <h3>TCP/IP</h3>
        <p>The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is a transport protocol that is used on top of IP to ensure reliable transmission of packets.TCP includes mechanisms to solve many of the problems that arise from packet-based messaging, such as lost packets, out of order packets, duplicate packets, and corrupted packets Internet Protocol address (IP address) is a numerical label such as that is connected to a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication </p>
    
        <h3>HOSTING</h3>
        <p>Hosting, in its most generic sense, is a service through which storage and computing resources are providing to an individual or organization for the accommodation and maintenance of one or more websites and related services    </p>
    
        <h3>DOMAIN</h3>
        <p>A domain is a network of computers and devices that are controlled by one set authority and have specific guidelines. More specifically, a domain is controlled by one particular company that has its own internet presence and IP address. The domain is labeled by its domain name, such as Webopedia or webopedia.com    </p>
    
        <h3>SERVER</h3>
        <p>Servers are high-powered computers built to store, process, and manage network data, devices, and systems. Servers are the engines powering organizations by providing network devices and systems with adequate resources    </p>
    
        <h3>CLIENT</h3>
        <p>A client is a computer that connects to and uses the resources of a remote computer or server. Many corporate networks comprise a client computer for each employee, each of which connects to the corporate server.    </p>

        <li><h4>What are HTML Entities? With Example.</h4>
        <p>Character entities are used to display reserved characters in HTML. ... &#entity_number;. To display a less than sign (<) we must write: &lt; or &#60;.</p></li>

        <li><h4>What are different types of lists in HTML? With Example.</h4>
        <p>There are mainly three types of lists in HTML: ordered list, unordered list, and description list. In HTML, an ordered list displays elements in sequential order.</p></li>

        <li><h4>What is the ‘class’ attribute in HTML? With Example.</h4>
        <p>The class attribute specifies one or more classnames for an element. The class attribute is mostly used to point to a class in a style sheet.</p></li>
        
        <li><h4>What is the difference between the ‘id’ attribute and the ‘class’ attribute of HTML elements? With Example.</h4>

        <li><h4>How is Cell Padding different from Cell Spacing? With Example.</h4>
            <p>Cellpadding basically defines the space present between a table cell's border and the content present in it. Cellspacing basically defines the space present between individual adjacent cells. One can create it using the tag of HTML 'table', but it sets the type attribute to cellpadding.</p></li>
            

        <li><h4>How can we club two or more rows or columns into a single row or column in an HTML table? With Example.</h4>
            <p>It can be done by using the rowspan and colspan attribute in HTML.  The rowspan is used to merge or combine the number of cells in a row whereas the colspan is used to merge column cells in a table.  
                <table border="1">
                    <tr>
                        <th>Name</th>
                        <th>Age</th>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Akku</td>
              
                        <!-- This cell will take up
                            space on two rows -->
                        <td rowspan="2">44</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>fahad</td>
                    </tr>
                </table>
            </p></li>

        <li><h4>What is the difference between a block-level element and an inline element?</h4>
        <p>Block Elements occupy the full width irrespective of their sufficiency. Inline elements don't start in a new line. Block elements always start in a line. Inline elements allow other inline elements to sit behind.</p></li>

        <li><h4>How to create a Hyperlink in HTML? With Example.</h4>
        <p>The 'a' tag defines a hyperlink, which is used to link from one page to another. The most important attribute of the 'a' element is the href attribute, which indicates the link's destination. By default, links will appear as follows in all browsers: An unvisited link is underlined and blue.</p></li>

        <li><h4>What is the use of an iframe tag? With Example.</h4>
        <p> The ” iframe ” tag defines a rectangular region within the document in which the browser can display a separate document, including scrollbars and borders. An inline frame is used to embed another document within the current HTML document.</p></li>
         
        <li><h4>What is the use of a span tag? Explain with example?</h4>
        <p>The <span> tag is an inline container used to mark up a part of a text, or a part of a document. The <span> tag is easily styled by CSS or manipulated with JavaScript using the class or id attribute. The 'span' tag is much like the 'div' element, but 'div' is a block-level element and 'span' is an inline element.</p></li>

        <li><h4> How to insert a picture into a background image of a web page? With Example.</h4>
        <p>To set the background image of a webpage, use the CSS style. Under the CSS 'style' tag, add the property background-image. The property sets a graphic such as jpg, png, svg, gif, etc. HTML5 do not support the 'body' background attribute, so CSS is used to change set background image.</p></li>
        
        <li><h4>How are active links different from normal links?</h4>
        <p>Normal links are links which are there on the page and have not been clicked yet. Active links are those links, which have just been clicked at that instant.</p></li>

        <li><h4>What are the different tags to separate sections of text?</h4>
            <p>We separate a section of texts in HTML using the below tags:
                <li type="circle">'br' tag – It is used to separate the line of text. It breaks the current line and shifts the flow of the text to a new line.</li>
              <li type="circle">'p' tag–This tag is used to write a paragraph of text.</li>
                <li type="circle">'blockquote' tag–This tag is used to define large quoted sections.</li></p></li>
 
        <li><h4>What is SVG?</h4>
        <p>The SVG file format is a popular tool for displaying two-dimensional graphics, charts, and illustrations on websites. Plus, as a vector file, it can be scaled up or down without losing any of its resolution.</p></li>
        
        <li><h4>What is difference between HTML and XHTML?</h4>
        <p>XHTML was developed to make HTML more extensible and flexible to work with other data formats (such as XML). In addition, browsers ignore errors in HTML pages, and try to display the website even if it has some errors in the markup. So XHTML comes with a much stricter error handling.</p></li>

        <li><h4></h4>What are logical and physical tags in HTML?</h4>
        <p>Physical and Logical tags are used in HTML for better visibility and understanding of the text by the user on the web page. However, both tags differ from each other as suggested by their names. Logical Tags : Logical Tags are used in HTML to display the text according to the logical styles.</p></li>
